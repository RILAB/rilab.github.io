<h3 id="prospective-grad-students">Prospective Grad Students</h3>
<p>I am currently accepting graduate students through the <a href="http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/">Plant Biology</a>, <a href="http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/">Population Biology</a>, <a href="http://ecology.ucdavis.edu">Ecology</a>, and <a href="http://igg.ucdavis.edu">Integrated Genetics and Genomics</a> graduate groups. If you’re interested in joining my lab, see my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jrossibarra/forgradschool">advice for grad school</a>, read a few of our papers, and then contact me and send along a CV.</p>
<h3 id="prospective-postdocs">Prospective PostDocs</h3>
<p>I’m always interested in recruiting talented postdoctoral candidates. In particular, I encourage people to contact me about writing postdoc fellowship proposals for <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF</a>, <a href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/fo/fellowshipsgrantprogramafri.cfm">USDA</a>, <a href="http://cpb.ucdavis.edu/CPB%20Postdoc%20Fellowship.html">CPB</a>, <a href="http://www.ucmexus.ucr.edu/funding/fellowship_post_doc.html">UC MEXUS</a>, or any of a number of other fellowship opportunities (see <a href="http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/04/some-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-biology.html">here</a> and <a href="http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dl384/Resources_Postdocs.html">here</a> for some nice lists). Please email me with your CV, and I’d be happy to discuss fellowship possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>I view my relationship with students and postdocs as a partenership. My job is to ensure people in the lab get the training and opportunities they need to advance in their chosen careers – whether academia, industry, teaching, or other options. In return, I expect lab members to contribute to a productive and friendly environment conducive to learning and research. This includes participation in lab activities – coffee hours, <a href="http://]www.rilab.org/rehab.html">REHAB</a>, lab meetings, and so on. On average, I expect most students to produce three publications over the course of their PhD, including at least one first-author paper. I expect somewhat greater productivity from postdocs on average – approximately 2 papers per year (I beleive the actuall running average is ~2.5). I strongly encourage collaboration, and a quick glance at our <a href="">publications</a> should show that this generally works well. I also encourage both students and postdocs to take advantage of opportunities to teach, write grants, supervise students, write papers independently or collaborate outside of the lab.</p>
<p>I feel strongly about open science. We write papers on github, often in public repos. We publish preprints as soon as a manuscript is ready for submission. We publish our data as soon as we can, preferably as separate data papers. We document our work – with github, R markdown, readme files, etc. – so it is intelligible and reusable in the future. I expect members of the lab to practice open science.</p>
