Two one-year postdoctoral positions are available in the labs of [Daniel Runcie](https://runcielab.ucdavis.edu) and [Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra](rilab.org) at the University of California Davis to develop and apply statistical and computational methods to study local adaptation in maize using genomic, transcriptomic and environmental data. 

We are studying the genetic basis and evolutionary history of maize adaptation to highland environments in Central and South America as part of a NSF funded project with collaborators at [UC Davis](https://gcbias.org), [Iowa State](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mhufford/HuffordLab/home.html), [USDA-ARS](http://web.missouri.edu/~flint-garcias/), [Penn State](https://plantscience.psu.edu/directory/ruairidh-sawers-ph.d), [NC State](https://www.rrlab.org/index.html) and [Langebio](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/en/Dr-Ruairidh-Sawers), Mexico. We are looking for researchers interested in tackling fundamental questions about the evolutionary forces that shape variation, divergence and adaptation of plant species in diverse environments. Potential directions include the quantitative genetics of gene expression variation, linking gene expression to physiological adaptations, the role of structural variation in gene regulatory networks and adaptation, inferring dispersal and demographic histories, or studying the consequences of introgression and migration on genomic architecture and selection. Exciting data sets on genetic and functional variation in diverse maize landraces and wild species are available to test creative hypotheses about the mechanisms of evolution.  

The ideal candidates would be interested in questions in evolutionary genomics or statistical genetics, and have a background in developing or applying statistical methods for population and/or quantitative genetics. Experience with R, python, C++, or other programming languages is desired. We believe in and value the power of diversity,
thus applicants from historically underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Opportunities exist for both positions to collaborate on a number of ongoing projects in both labs, including statistical methods for gene expression analysis, quantitative genetic and functional genomic analysis of adaptive phenotypes, and population genetics of reinforcement or genetic load.  Both positions are for one year, with the potential for a second year of support conditional on performance. Start dates are open-ended, with preference for earlier dates.

UC Davis has extremely strong programs in both plant and evolutionary biology. Candidates would have the opportunity to interact with members of the Center for Population Biology and the Genome Center as well as the Depts. of Plant Sciences and Evolution and Ecology.  For additional information about our labs please visit [runcielab.ucdavis.edu](runcielab.ucdavis.edu) or [rilab.org](rilab.org).

For more information or to apply, please send a cover letter and a CV with a list of references and a statement of interest to `deruncie@ucdavis.edu` or `rossibarra@ucdavis.edu`. We will begin reviewing applications on August 12.
