<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Lab Expectations</h1>

</div>


<p>I view my relationship with students and postdocs as a partnership.
My job is to ensure people in the lab get the training and opportunities
they need to advance in their chosen careers, whether in academia,
industry, teaching, or other options. Below you can find information on
the lab philosophy and expectations of lab members. Text and ideas in
places borrow heavily from <a
href="http://www.rrlab.org/expectations.html">Rubén
Rellán-Álvarez</a>.</p>
<div id="general-rules" class="section level2">
<h2>General Rules</h2>
<div id="safety-first" class="section level3">
<h3>Safety first</h3>
<p>Your health and safety are more important than your research. This
includes adhering to lab safety codes, as well as maintaining your
physical and mental health. Never work in the lab if you are feeling
sick, under medication that might affect your ability to work normally
and definitely not under the effects of any kind of drugs. Avoid working
in the lab by yourself doing potentially dangerous activities, and
please be aware of UC Davis resources and training on <a
href="http://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/categories/laboratory-safety">lab
safety</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="respect" class="section level3">
<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>I expect lab members to contribute to a productive and friendly
environment conducive to learning and research. This includes treating
your colleagues with respect, listening to others’ viewpoints and ideas,
and ensuring the lab is a place where everybody feels welcome and
appreciated. Racist, sexist, or other inappropriate comments or behavior
will not be tolerated under any circumstance. The university provides a
number of <a
href="http://studentexpression.ucdavis.edu/get-support/index.html">resources</a>
(confidential and otherwise) to report or discuss any such activity you
feel is inappropriate.</p>
</div>
<div id="expectations-for-all-members" class="section level3">
<h3>Expectations (for all members)</h3>
<div id="work-hours" class="section level4">
<h4>Work hours</h4>
<p>We are lucky enough to work in an area where flexible working hours
are the norm. In order to be able to interact with the rest of the
persons in the lab, we generally expect lab members to be present the
majority of normal business hours (9-5pm) during the work week, since
this is when most academic activities occur. There may be times when
your project requires work late at night or on the weekends, but you are
<em>not</em> expected to regularly work more than a normal 40-hour work
week. It is important that you take time off for personal life,
vacations, etc. I do ask, however, that you notify me if you will be
absent for ≥1 day, and let me know in advance of any extended leave.</p>
</div>
<div
id="seminars-journal-clubs-and-other-lab-and-institutional-activities"
class="section level4">
<h4>Seminars, journal clubs and other lab and institutional
activities</h4>
<p>Attendance to regular weekly lab meetings is expected of all lab
members. Participation in weekly lab coffee, Zeavolution and other
regular meetings, and <a href="rehab.html">R.E.H.A.B.</a> is encouraged
but not required. Note that if you are funded on one of the lab’s
current grants, you are expected to attend those meetings as well. There
are a number of seminars (Plant Biology, Genetics, Population Biology,
Ecology &amp; Evolution, Plant Sciences) each week, and these are
usually posted in the office. You are strongly encouraged to regularly
go to one or more each week.</p>
</div>
<div id="conferences" class="section level4">
<h4>Conferences</h4>
<p>Everyone is encouraged to attend at least one conference a year.
Members of the lab regularly attend such meetings as the maize meeting,
SMBE, Evolution, and ESA. The department and university offer travel
funding for graduate students and postdocs, and you should apply for
external sources of funding to help cover travel expenses. Whenever
possible, I will help fund attendance at one conference per year for
each member of the lab on the condition that you are presenting a poster
or talk at the meeting. Please provide ample time before the deadline
for reviewing abstracts and posters or practicing talks.</p>
</div>
<div id="authorship" class="section level4">
<h4>Authorship</h4>
<p>We follow the <a
href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">IJME
rules for authorship rules</a>:<br />
1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or
the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;
AND<br />
2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
intellectual content; AND<br />
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND<br />
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the
work are appropriately investigated and resolved. Projects evolve over
time and authorship inclusion and author order will be re-evaluated
accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-science" class="section level4">
<h4>Open Science</h4>
<p>I feel strongly that open science is important. We write papers on
github or <a href="overleaf.com">overleaf</a>, often in public repos. We
publish preprints as soon as a manuscript is ready for submission. We
publish our data as soon as we can, and I am pushing to start doing so
as separate data papers. We document our work – with github, R markdown,
readme files, etc. – so it is intelligible and reusable in the future. I
expect members of the lab to practice open science.</p>

<h3>Postdocs and senior PhD students</h3>

<h4>My responsibilities to postdocs and senior PhD students:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assist with identifying and writing postdoctoral fellowships.<br />
</li>
<li>Develop project ideas, including independent projects that can be
taken with the postdoc.</li>
<li>Interpret results.</li>
<li>Proof-read manuscripts.</li>
<li>Discuss future career goals (e.g., do you want to teach, go into
academia, industry, continue in research?), and plan ways to facilitate
these goals.</li>

<h4>Expectations of postdocs and senior PhD students:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for our regular progress/pitfalls meetings and a follow up
email of progress and goals.<br />
</li>
<li>Write and submit manuscripts. I strongly encourage collaboration,
and a quick glance at our <a href="pubs.html">publications</a> should
show that this generally works well. On average I expect your time as a
postdoc in the lab to generate ~2 papers per year (first or
co-authored), and in general this expectation seems to be not
unreasonable.</li>
<li>Proof-read manuscripts from other lab members.<br />
</li>
<li>Apply for external funding (either individual postdoc fellowships or
contributing to larger lab grant writing).<br />
</li>
<li>Maintain a set of lab notes, including directories of data,
annotated codes &amp; versions, detailed methods. These need to
sufficient to reproduce results without additional instructions. A good
working example can be found <a
href="https://github.com/timbeissinger/Maize-Teo-Scripts">here</a>.</li>
<li>Participate in general lab responsibilities (servers, maintain
common areas, taking turns hosting visitors). Participate in talk
rehearsals of your colleagues.</li>
<li>Optional, but encouraged: Mentor at least one undergraduate
student.</li>
