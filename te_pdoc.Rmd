Two postdoctoral positions are available in the labs of [Emily Josephs](https://josephslab.github.io) at Michigan State University and [Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra](rilab.org) at the University of California Davis to work on an NSF funded project studing the evolutionary genetics of transposable elements (TEs) in maize. The position in the Josephs lab will focus on the phenotypic effects of TE polymorphisms using quantitative genetics approaches and the position in the Ross-Ibarra lab will focus on the population genetics of TEs within and between species. Opportunities exist for both positions to collaborate on a number of ongoing projects in both labs. We believe in and value the power of diversity and applicants from historically underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Ideal candidates will have a background in transposable element biology, population genetics, and/or quantitative genetics. Experience with R, python, C++, or other programming languages is a plus. Both positions are for one year, with the potential for two more years of support conditional on performance. Start dates are open-ended, with preference for earlier dates. 

Both Michigan State and UC Davis have strong programs in both plant and evolutionary biology. For additional information about our labs please visit josephslab.github.io and rilab.org. 

We will begin reviewing applications on August 12. To apply, please send a cover letter and a CV with a list of references and a statement of interest to josep993@msu.edu and/or rossibarra@ucdavis.edu. Please indicate in the letter if you’d like to apply to one or both positions and, if both, whether you have a preference about which lab you’d be based in. If you are interested in applying to the MSU position, please also submit application materials to the [MSU website](http://careers.msu.edu/cw/en-us/job/502026/research-associatefixed-term).
