A postdoctoral position is available in [our lab](index.html) in the departmebnt of Evolution and Ecology at the University of California Davis to work on an NSF funded project studing the evolutionary genetics of transposable elements (TEs) in maize. The position will focus on the population genetics of TEs within and between species of Zea. Opportunities exist to collaborate on a number of ongoing projects, along with additional labs involved in the project ([Nathan Springer’s lab](https://maizeumn.github.io) and [Candace Hirsch’s lab](http://hirschlab.cfans.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota, [Emily Joseph's lab](https://josephslab.github.io) at the University of Michigan and [Shawn Kaeppler’s lab](https://agronomy.wisc.edu/shawn-kaeppler/) at the University of Wisconsin). We believe in and value the power of diversity and applicants from historically underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Ideal candidates will have a background in transposable element biology, population genetics, and/or quantitative genetics. Experience with R, python, C++, or other programming languages is a plus. The position is for one year, with the potential for two more years of support conditional on performance. Start dates are open-ended, with preference for earlier dates. 

UC Davis has strong programs in both plant and evolutionary biology, including the [Center for Population Biology](https://cpb.ucdavis.edu)  

We will begin reviewing applications on May 23. To apply, please send a cover letter and a CV with a list of references to rossibarra@ucdavis.edu.
