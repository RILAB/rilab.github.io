## Prospective lab members

If you are interestd in joining the lab, please also see information on [expectations](expectations.html) for lab members.

### Prospective Undergraduates

We are always interested in including undergraduates in our research.  Undergraduate research can be for credit (via a 192 or 199) or as a paid position, depending on current research needs. There are a number of [current research opportunities](research_opps.html) in the lab, but students with prior experience are also encouraged to develop their own independent research projects.  A number of previous undergraduates have successfully [published their work](undergrad_pubs.html).  If you are interested in work in the lab, please take a look at some of the recent [papers from the lab](pubs.html) and contact [Dr. Ross-Ibarra](mailto:rossibarra@ucdavis.edu) with a CV, an unofficial transcript, and a mention of what you're interested in working on, and we can set up an interview!

### Prospective Grad Students

I am currently accepting graduate students through the [Plant Biology](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/), [Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/), [Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu), and [Integrated Genetics and Genomics](http://igg.ucdavis.edu) graduate groups. If you're interested in joining my lab, see my [advice for grad school](http://www.slideshare.net/jrossibarra/forgradschool), read a few of our papers, and then contact me and send along a CV.

### Prospective PostDocs

I'm always interested in recruiting talented postdoctoral candidates. In particular, I encourage people to contact me about writing postdoc fellowship proposals for [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3), [USDA](http://www.csrees.usda.gov/fo/fellowshipsgrantprogramafri.cfm), [CPB](http://cpb.ucdavis.edu/CPB%20Postdoc%20Fellowship.html), [UC MEXUS](http://www.ucmexus.ucr.edu/funding/fellowship_post_doc.html), or any of a number of other fellowship opportunities (see [here](http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/04/some-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-biology.html) and [here](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dl384/Resources_Postdocs.html) for some nice lists). Please email me with your CV, and I'd be happy to discuss fellowship possibilities.
