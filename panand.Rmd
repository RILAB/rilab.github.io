We are hiring a postdoctoral scholar to work on the evolutionary genetics of convergent evolution across multiple populations of eight species of [Andropogoneae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andropogoneae) grasses. The candidate will be responsible for population genetic analysis (but not collection) of whole genome sequence data to quantify convergent evolution across populations and species. The project is a collaboration with [Ed Buckler](http://www.maizegenetics.net), [Matthew Hufford](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mhufford/HuffordLab/home.html), [Toby Kellogg](http://kellogglab.weebly.com), [Adam Siepel](http://siepellab.labsites.cshl.edu), and [Qi Sun](http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/staff/qisun/) to use evidence of convergence across deep evolutionary time to identify functional sites and inform machine learning models to predict gene expression and phenotype.

Applicants should have a background in evolutionary biology, with experience in population genetic analysis of genome-scale data.  The successful candidate should be able to communicate and interact effectively as part of a team of researchers â€“ please see our [lab expectations](expectations.html) for details.  Interested applicants should [email](mailto:rossibarra@ucdavis.edu) a cover letter describing their research interests, a current CV, and contact information for three references.  

The Ross-Ibarra lab is committed to ensuring a safe, friendly, and diverse workplace for all of its members, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, or medical conditions. We especially encourage applications from persons traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Please check the UC Davis website for information about [salaries](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/1819/2018-19-adj-scales/t23.pdf) and [work/life in Davis as a postdoc](http://postdocs.ucdavis.edu). The start date is flexible, with preference for early-mid 2019.

**Application review will begin Sept. 15, 2018.**
