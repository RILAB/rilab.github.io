## Prospective lab memebers

### Prospective Grad Students

I am currently accepting graduate students through the [Plant Biology](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/), [Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/), and (soon) [Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu) graduate groups. If you're interested in joining my lab, see my [advice for grad school](http://www.slideshare.net/jrossibarra/forgradschool), read a few of our papers, and then contact me and send along a CV. 

### Prospective PostDocs

I'm always interested in recruiting talented postdoctoral candidates. In particular, I encourage people to contact me about writing postdoc fellowship proposals for [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3), [USDA](http://www.csrees.usda.gov/fo/fellowshipsgrantprogramafri.cfm), [CPB](http://cpb.ucdavis.edu/CPB%20Postdoc%20Fellowship.html), or any of [a number of other fellowship opportunities](http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/04/some-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-biology.html). Please email me with your CV, and I'd be happy to discuss fellowship possibilities.
