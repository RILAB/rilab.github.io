## Prospective lab memebers

### Prospective Grad Students

I am currently accepting graduate students through the [Plant Biology](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/), [Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/), [Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu), and [Integrated Genetics and Genomics](http://igg.ucdavis.edu) graduate groups. If you're interested in joining my lab, see my [advice for grad school](http://www.slideshare.net/jrossibarra/forgradschool), read a few of our papers, and then contact me and send along a CV. 

### Prospective PostDocs

I'm always interested in recruiting talented postdoctoral candidates. In particular, I encourage people to contact me about writing postdoc fellowship proposals for [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3), [USDA](http://www.csrees.usda.gov/fo/fellowshipsgrantprogramafri.cfm), [CPB](http://cpb.ucdavis.edu/CPB%20Postdoc%20Fellowship.html), [UC MEXUS](http://www.ucmexus.ucr.edu/funding/fellowship_post_doc.html), or any of a number of other fellowship opportunities (see [here](http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/04/some-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-biology.html) and [here](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dl384/Resources_Postdocs.html) for some nice lists). Please email me with your CV, and I'd be happy to discuss fellowship possibilities. 

### Expectations

I view my relationship with students and postdocs as a partenership. My job is to ensure people in the lab get the training and opportunities they need to advance in their chosen careers -- whether academia, industry, teaching, or other options.  In return, I expect lab members to contribute to a productive and friendly environment conducive to learning and research. This includes participation in lab activities -- coffee hours, [REHAB](http://]www.rilab.org/rehab.html), lab meetings, and so on. On average, I expect most students to produce three publications over the course of their PhD, including at least one first-author paper.  I expect somewhat greater productivity from postdocs on average -- approximately 2 papers per year (I beleive the actuall running average is ~2.5). I strongly encourage collaboration, and a quick glance at our [publications]() should show that this generally works well. I also encourage both students and postdocs to take advantage of opportunities to teach, write grants, supervise students, write papers independently or collaborate outside of the lab.

I feel strongly about open science. We write papers on github, often in public repos.  We publish preprints as soon as a manuscript is ready for submission.  We publish our data as soon as we can, preferably as separate data papers. We document our work -- with github, R markdown, readme files, etc. -- so it is intelligible and reusable in the future. I expect members of the lab to practice open science.
