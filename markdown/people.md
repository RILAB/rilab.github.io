* Jeff is an Associate Professor in the Dept. of Plant Sciences. He started at UC Davis in 2009. His latest musings can be followed on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jrossibarra).

### Postdoctoral Scholars

**Sofiane Mezmouk**

* Sofiane joined the lab in early 2012 after doing a PhD at INRA and Biogemma, where he worked on maize association mapping.  He is work focuses on genetic load and the basis of heterosis.  Sofiane is also the resident quantitative geneticist, leading or collaborating on several mapping projects in the lab. 

**Sayuri Tsukahara**

* Sayuri joined the lab in April 2013 to study mutants of kinetochore proteins in maize.  Previously, her PhD work focused on retrotransposition and centromere targeting in methylation mutants of Arabdopsis.

### Graduate Students

**Paul Bilinski**

* Paul is a 4th year student in [Plant Biology](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/gradGroups/pb/), working on the evolution of genome size and repeat sequences in *Zea* and *Tripsacum*.

**Anna O'Brien**

* Anna is a 3rd year student in [Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/), coadvised by [Sharon Strauss](http://sharonstrauss.wordpress.com). Anna works on the coevolution of teosinte and mycorrhiza.

**Michelle Stitzer**

* Michelle is a 1st year student in [Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/), working on the population genetics of transposable elements in maize and teosinte.

**Dianne Velasco**

* Dianne is a 4th year student in [Integrated Genetics and Genomics](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/GradGroups/GGG/Default.aspx), working on the genomics of *Prunus*.
 
**Laura Vann**

* Laura is a 5th year student in [Integrated Genetics and Genomics](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/GradGroups/GGG/Default.aspx), working on the molecular ecology of Joshua Trees and teosinte.

### Staff

[**Vince Buffalo**](http://www.vincebuffalo.com/)

* Vince is a bioinformatician and aspiring evolutionary geneticist who joined the lab in mid 2013 as the lead on our analyses of genome sequences from natural teosinte populations. 

**Anne Lorant**

* Anne has worked as a technician/lab manager since November of 2012, running our lab and greenhouse experiments.

### Undergraduate Students

[**Arun Durvasula**](https://github.com/arundurvasula)

* Arun is working on simulation approaches to reassessing the maize domestication bottleneck, and [tweaking libsequence](https://github.com/arundurvasula/libsequencevcf-1.7.6) in his spare time.

**Sid Bhadra-Lobo**

* Sid is working on mapping centromere repeat abundance across a panel of maize lines.
