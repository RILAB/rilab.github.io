### January 2015

* Our paper on [origins and evolution of ancient maize in the Southwest US](http://www.rilab.org/pdfs/fonseca2015.pdf) got a fair amount of press: 
	* [UC Davis Press Release](http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=11124)  
	* [Science World Report](http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/21122/20150112/origins-maize-dna-tests-reveal-two-paths.htm)  
	* [Archaeology](http://www.archaeology.org/news/2879-150108-southwest-corn-dna)  
	* [SiNC](http://www.agenciasinc.es/Noticias/El-maiz-entro-en-el-suroeste-de-EE-UU-hace-4.000-anos-a-traves-de-la-montana)  
	* [Science magazine](http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/01/how-corn-became-corn)  
	* [Nature Plants commentary](http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants20149)  
	* [The Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41865/title/Corn-Chronicle/)
	

* Brief mention of our work on highland maize adaptation in the [Daily Democrat](http://www.dailydemocrat.com/general-news/20150110/uc-davis-scientists-work-to-id-food-crops-that-can-survive-global-warming). 

### October 2014

* Jeff is quoted in [The Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41194/title/360-Degree-View-of-the-Tomato/) discusing recent tomato resquencing work 
* Our recent review on [advances and limitations to using popgen to study local adaptation](http://www.rilab.org/pdfs/tiffin2014.pdf) mentioned in a blog post at the [Molecular Ecologist](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2014/10/how-many-markers-does-it-take-to-make-a-dataset-genomic/)  
* Jeff's mild annoyance with the continued debate about one or two rice origins is noted in a quote in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7524_supp/full/514S58a.html). Why won't anyone argue for seventeen origins?


### June 2013

* Our paper on the domesticaiton locus [grassy tillers](http://journals.plos.org/ploscollections/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003604) is highlighted in the [PLoS Plant Trasnslational Research collection](http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v01.i25).


### June 2012

* In which Jeff learns not to let the publicists write quotes for him. In the [UC Davis Press Release](http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10267) on the HapMap2 papers by Hufford et al. and Chia et al., Jeff is quoted as claiming the work will solve hunger, improve yield, create world peace. If only we'd had higher depth sequencing we could have solved the JFK assassination too.

### September 2011

* [U Wisconsin press release](http://www.news.wisc.edu/19804) on identification of the causal transposable element behind the domestication gene [tb1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946354).

### November 2010

* [UC Davis piece](http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=9679) on Jeff's [PECASE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pressroom/11052010) award.
