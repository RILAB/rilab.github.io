## General Rules

### Safety first

Your health and safety are more important than your research. This includes adhering to lab safety codes, as well as maintaining your physical and mental health. Never work in the lab if you are feeling sick, under medication that might affect your ability to work normally and definitely not under the effects of any kind of drugs. Try to avoid working in the lab by yousrself doing potentially dangerous things like extractions etc. If you are working alone in the lab, let the security guards where you are.    

Please read the official Langebio safety rules [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/docs/blob/master/docs/Reglamento%20general%20Langebio%20Nov2015%202.pdf). You should

### Respect

- Treat your colleagues with due respect. Racial or sexist comments will not be tolerated under any circumstance. The lab should be a place where everybody feels welcome and appreciated.
- At any given time your colleagues in the lab will be doing different activities that require different levels of concentration. Respect this. No music in your speakers, keep the volume of your conversations at a reasonable volume. If you want to take a break with a colleague and have a chat, is ok, but do it outside in the garden or cafeteria and don´t distract your colleagues.

### Expectations (for all members).

#### Work hours.  
We are lucky enough to work in an area where flexible working hours are the norm. There will be times when your project requires to work in the weekends or late. Is OK then to take some time off. However in order to be able to interact with the rest of the persons in the labs we expect everyone to be in the lab **between 9:00 to 14:00** since this is when most of the academic activities will happen. If, for whatever reason you can´t make it on regularly basis we have to know. If you take holidays, let us know in advance and fill out the corresponding *comisión*. Same applies if you go to do field work. If you don´t do it becomes complicated to plan anything.   

#### Seminars, journal clubs and other lab and institutional activities.   
Assistance to institutional Tuesday seminars, journal clubs, lab meetings, LGACS etc, are *mandatory*. No excuses. If you are presenting in the journal club send manuscript **1 week** before. Lab meeting, journal clubs etc are as good as the amount of dedication the speaker and the audience put on it. Don´t do a lousy job if you are presenting. Remember that your colleagues are taking time to listen to you. Respect that.

#### Conferences and field work.  
Everybody is encouraged to assist to at least one conference a year. Master and PhD students can apply to the master and PhD program funding. Postdocs should speak with us to find ways to cover costs. Everybody should apply for every possible external source of funding to help cover travel expenses. You should send us the abstract you are submitting with enough time to check if everything looks good and ensure that authorship, acknowledgements, sources of funding etc are correct. If we don´t receive your abstract draft **10 days before** the abstract submission deadline we will assume that you don´t want to go to the conference.  
Follow everything we said about respecting others when you are out in a conference or doing field work.

#### Authorship.
We follow the [IJME rules for authorship rules](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html):   
1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND  
2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  
Projects evolve over time and authorship, inclusion and author order will be re-evaluated accordingly.

## Specific rules for the different members of the lab.

### Postdocs.  

#### Our responsibilities to postdocs and senior PhD students:  

- Assist with identifying and writing postdoctoral fellowships.  
- Develop project ideas, including independent projects that can be taken with the postdoc.
- Interpret results.
- Proof-read manuscripts.
- Discuss future career goals (e.g., do you want to teach, go into academia, continue in research?), and plan ways to facilitate these goals.
- Meet weekly to discuss progress & pitfalls.  

#### Expectations of postdocs and senior PhD students:
- Prepare for our regular progress/pitfalls meetings and a follow up email of progress and goals.  
- Write and submit manuscripts.  
- Proof-read manuscripts from other lab members.  
- Apply for external funding (either individual postdoc fellowships or contributing to larger lab grant writing).  
- Maintain a set of lab notes, including directories of data, annotated codes & versions, detailed methods. These need to sufficient to reproduce results without additional instructions. See more in the [data wiki](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/data).
- Participate in general lab responsibilities (servers, maintain common areas, taking turns hosting visitors, communal sampling and field work etc). Participate in talk rehearsals of your colleagues.
- Be available in the lab/office for a minimum pre-arranged set of hours to facilitate interactions.  
- Give at least one institutional seminar per year.
- Optional, but preferred: Mentor at least one undergraduate student.

### Master and junior PhD students.
We are both members of the Integrative Biology and Plant Biotechnology programs. If you are interested in joining our labs we highly recommend you to take a look at what we do in our labs. (See webpages) and read what we have done before. Rotations are the best way for you to get a feel of the labs, interact with us and other members of the labs and for us to get to know you better and if you will be a good fit to the labs and our labs for you.

#### Our responsibilities to Master and junior PhD students:

- Develop project ideas.   
- Interpret results.  
- Proof-read and contribute to writing of thesis, abstracts and hopefully manuscripts.  
- Discuss future career goals (e.g., do you want to teach, go into academia, continue in research?), and plan ways to facilitate these goals.  
- Meet weekly to discuss progress and pitfalls.

- Write thesis in due time (i.e. before your fellowship is over).  
- Proof-read manuscripts from other lab members. Participate in talk rehearsals of your colleagues.  
- Participate in general lab responsibilities (servers, maintain common areas, taking turns hosting visitors, communal sampling and field work etc). Participate in talk rehearsals of your colleagues.  
- Present a poster or talk of research progress at conference at least once a year.
