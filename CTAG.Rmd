# Corn Transcriptome Analysis Group

<a href="https://github.com/rossibarra/CV"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Corn_icon.png" style="width: 30px;"></a> The CTAG currently consists of the [Hufford](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mhufford/HuffordLab/home.html) and [Ross-Ibarra](www.rilab.org) labs. We've done exactly 1 RNA-seq experiment, and know how to use [EdgeR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html), so we feel we're qualified.  If you'd like to join the CTAG, or purchase the name from us ($10), please contact us at [ctag@ctag.ctag](mailto:rossibarra@ucdavis.edu).
