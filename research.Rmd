## **Genetics of adaptation**
<img src="images/teosinte.jpg" width="150" align="right"/>

Maize spread rapidly after domestication, adapting to a wide range of environments.
Today maize is grown across a broader geographic breadth than any of the world's other staple crops, from sea level to altitudes of $>4,000$m and from deserts to near-flooded conditions. The wild relatives of maize have also adapted to environments varying widely in elevation, temperature, and moisture availability. The lab works on a number of projects using maize and its wild relatives to understand the genetic basis of adaptation. See also our brief [history of maize](maize_history.html).

## **Experimental Evolution**
<img src="images/corn.jpg" width="150" align="right"/>


Plant domestication and modern breeding represent examples of experimentally evolved populations. Studying these populations provides an opportunity to understand not only the genetic basis of evolutionary change but also how the processes of evolution interact to shape modern genetic and phenotypic diversity.

## **Human-Maize Coevolution**. 

<img src="images/aztec.jpg" width="150" align="right"/>

As a domesticate maize is entirely dependent on humans for survival and dispersal. In turn, human populations became increasingly dependent on maize as a staple crop. Much of the current work in the lab investigates the dynamics of how each of these two species have impacted the evolution of the other.

## **Genome Evolution**

<img src="images/panel.jpeg" width="150" align="right"/>


In addition to discerning the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, we are interested in understanding the processes that shape evolution of the genome itself. From copy number variation and inversions to the evolution of recombination rate and coevolution between transposable elements and their hosts, the diversity and evolutionary lability of genomes offers a lot to explore.
